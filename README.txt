Basic Overview:
Floors is a game that generates random levels (floors) for you to complete. In order to beat each level you have to kill all the enemies in the level. The floors will get harder the higher up you get, however when you die you will be able to resume starting from the floor you died on (probably gonna change this). The game will be multiplayer either online or just local (probably just local for a while). Every ten levels there is going to be a boss that you fight. The boss will randomly take one item from your inventory, but it can't take weapons from you that way you can still kill it.

Ideas:
  - PvP
  - Checkpoints every 5 levels
  - Different types of playstyles (Mages, Archers, etc.)
  - Leaderboards (who is on the highest floor, most kills, etc.)
  - Crafting (probably will be added a while later)
